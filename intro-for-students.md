# Welcome to the Code Lab!

## What makes the Code Lab different? Who is it for?

### After work/school

We focus on helping people who might want to include code as part of their _current_ career, rather than those wishing to completely change careers. We assume you're already a full-time student or professional, so you don't have to drop everything to advance your coding skills. Because we believe _everyone_ should have a chance to learn to code. No matter what your goals are, programming can help you be orders of magnitude more effective in achieving them.

### Real world

Unlike many online courses, where you might code in a little window on a website, we believe in removing as many abstractions from real work as possible. That means you'll be doing all your work on your own laptop, using the tools and processes that actual developers use. And with every project, you'll make real websites, live on the Internet. At the Code Lab, you'll be an Actual Developer from day one.

### Personal training

The Lansing Code Lab is led not only by a professional web developer, but also a trained and experienced educator. This sets us apart from the vast majority of bootcamps, university degree programs, and online courses. By integrating cutting edge curriculum design with educational psychology, we bring you a uniquely student-directed and emotionally intelligent experience.

### The Code Lab is for you

The Code Lab fits into your life, it gives you real world experience, and you get personal coaching to keep you on track. If you keep coming, you'll keep getting better. If you want to take a break to go on vacation, don't pay that month. And when you come back, you can work on what matters most to _you_.

## What you should know as a student

### Errors are _normal_

If you try something and it doesn't work, that's OK. That happens to professional developers every single day. Sometimes, the errors tell you exactly what you need to do to fix them. Other times, they'll be very cryptic or alarmist, like "Error 286: CRITICAL FAILURE!" 286? What does that mean? And "CRITICAL FAILURE" in all caps? Isn't that a bit overdramatic?

Usually in these cases, you can __search Google for the name of the software you're working with and the contents of the error__, and you'll find someone else who already solved the problem and posted a solution.

Other times, you'll feel like this:

Which brings me to my next point.

### Asking for help is normal and _necessary_

When you've tried Googling, but you're truly stuck and have no idea what to do next, ask for help. Professionals have to all the time. There's even a website dedicated to coding questions called [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). As of writing, there are 10,210,784 questions that have been asked there. That's 10,210,784 times someone, very often a professional, has been become utterly and completely stumped. And no one else at their company was able to figure it out either. So they went to the Internet to say, "Here's what's happening. I have no idea why. So, umm...help please?"

![Tech support cheat sheet](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png)

Like I said, this is normal! The world of code is _huge_ and no one can possibly know everything. That's why we share. But for the many of us with perfectionist tendencies, sharing can be really hard. It's difficult to put something out there that we _know_ is broken or at least imperfect. What if someone tells us that we're stupid?

Fortunately, the most talented coders will _never_ tell you you're stupid. They know they only got where they are by asking lots and _lots_ of questions. It's the only cure for ignorance. They became better by putting themselves out there and learning from dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of other programmers. So believe it or not...

#### Learning to code requires vulnerability

You'll be publishing a lot of projects online and sharing a lot of code with the world. And it _won't_ be perfect. That's OK. Perfect code doesn't even exist, just like a perfect novel doesn't exist. But you still have to put yourself out there.

In the words of Neil Gaiman:

> The moment you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That’s the moment you may be starting to get it right. [*](https://vimeo.com/42372767#t=11m50s)

![Neil Gaiman](http://cbldf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NEIL-GAIMAN_510x380.jpg)

But in order to maintain the emotional capacity to follow this advice, you have to...

### Take care of yourself

If you're hungry, tired, or stressed, you'll be more emotionally volatile, so will be more likely to succumb to anxiety and anger. These emotions divert resources from your higher brain functions, making you _even more likely_ to make mistakes. Which will make you more anxious and angry.

It's a spiral. So when you notice it's happening, __stop and take care of the source of the problem__. You can always come back to this another time. Specially, here are 3 seemingly simple rules to help you be successful.

#### 1. Get enough sleep

Seriously. A day without enough sleep can make you useless and you won't get that day back.

#### 2. Take time to settle your mind

I recommend regular practice of at least one of the following:

- __Vigorous exercise__. The health of the body really does contribute to the health of the mind.
- __Meditation__. Vipassana meditation in particular has a nice, simple focus on mindfulness and it's the only practice I know of that's completely friendly to both theists and atheists. There are also YouTube channels and mobile apps with guided meditation that many find useful - Headspace and Calm are two that I know of.
- __Yoga__. Search _30 Day Yoga Challenge_ or _Yoga for beginners_ on YouTube for a good place to start.
- __Cuddle with a cat__. Hey, it helps a lot of people! If there's something else that helps to calm and center you personally, do that.

... _be present in the meow_ ...

#### 4. Eat when you're hungry

It's easy to get carried away with a project, thinking, "Oh, I'm hungry. I should eat." Then coding for just... a little... longer.

Please, stop. Eat. Trust me, you'll be much more productive when your body isn't slowly shutting down your cognitive functions.

## Rules

Yes, there are rules. We need rules, because we want everyone to feel safe and productive in our space.

The overarching rule is essentially __be kind, to everyone, all the time__. That's it. If you can't be kind, take a walk and cool off. If you have a problem with someone, talk to Chris Fritz and he'll help you work it out.

One problem with this rule though, is sometimes we can be _accidentally_ unkind. To help you avoid this, we enforce [the same social rules as Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules). Please read them now to help you avoid implicity unkindness. They are important.
